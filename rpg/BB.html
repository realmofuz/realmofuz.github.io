			<h2>Arc 1</h2>
			<h3>Prologue</h3>
			<p><i>Every so often, someone goes through a door and ends up somewhere strange.</i></p>
			<p>Somewhere, there is a bar.</p>
			<p>There are a million different places where you can enter the bar - and yet, those who search for it may spend years looking all the same. You may find it at the end of a dangerous temple in a sprawling foreign jungle - behind a vault made of near-impenetrable metal on a strange planet, within a deep and dark oceanic abyss. You may find a door to it after a lifetime of searching-and upon closing it, find it leading to a different place entirely when it opens next.</p>
			<p>But just as many find it by pure chance. A cook stumbles into it after opening a dusty cupboard. A priest discovers a strange gate within their temple. The bar may seem fickle and erratic with who it chooses, but I tell you, what drives it is not simply chance. The threads of fate weave and intertwine within, past a fireplace that glows many colors at once, behind a counter serving every imaginable drink in the Plane, through the hollow souls of the clockwork bartenders that make their ways through its common room.</p>
			<p>And I sit, and I watch, unseen by all but those who I want to see me. The threads join and form tapestries before my eyes, destinies weave and conflict and combine. The game is played and the pieces moved, as the Greater Plane, this vast and chaotic world of worlds that we live in, itself shakes in response.</p>
			<p>So I welcome you now, whoever and whatever you are. I am its proprietor, and I invite you here to this beautiful, wonderful, strange and dangerous backways bar.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Continent</h3>
			<p>Though there are countless worlds in the Greater Plane, I shall only speak of one for now. As fate has seemingly chosen this particular planet to be quite an important one, I’ve noticed many of the newcomers to the bar hail from it. One continent in particular stands apart from the rest - surrounded by oceans, medium in size and populated, by among several, three central nations - all edging forwards continuously along the very brink of war with one another.</p>
			<p>It is here where we shall begin.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu 1</h3>
			<p>A new figure arrives at the Bar.</p>
			<p>They are tall and thin, clad in many layers of silk robes and carrying themselves forwards with an elegant air. Two curling horns sprout from their pale, almost unhealthy facade, and they carry a crooked cane, limping as they walk.</p>
			<p>They’re almost akin in a way to a tiefling, a race from a world rather distant from the one this newcomer hails from. In fact, an actual tiefling, a weathered planeshifter in utilitarian vestments, takes a suspicious glance at them as they settle onto a barstool with a mix of practiced grace and staggered force - recognizing soon that they aren’t one of their kind despite their appearance.</p>
			<p>The figure does not respond, though, and with their legs finally supported, the grace of their steps wins out, and they vaguely sign to the bartender a large and extravagant cocktail. The automaton understands the order and begins to prepare it deftly as they settle down in preparation.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Neshu, pas Aventaria</h3>
			<p>A Lunar Priest, a worshiper of the god of the moon and death Daekkan within the Vylmaran capital, the one that styles themself Neshu is observantly not truly a tiefling, despite using magical cosmetic touches to better resemble one. Neshu's marks, discoloration, and ill health are all products of the various deals that the human, or so I am sure of, has made with various godlike beings, demons, and spirits over the years in exchange for power, knowledge, and most importantly, life.</p>
			<p>Though during the day they are a normal, if not slightly unorthodox, Lunar Priest, Neshu moonlights as a member of the House of the Fourfold Path, a secret society of alchemists and occultists attempting to find the secrets to immortality.</p>
			<p>In fact, they are one of the more advanced human members of the House, being 348 years of age as of the most recent spring. Still, this is thanks to a house of cards in magical terms, and this extended lifespan is in a constant state of near-failure and just-in-time fixes. The on-demand Blue-Gold Elixir from my bar has greatly aided with their condition, but I believe Neshu seems to yearn for a more permanent solution - as does seemingly every member of their order.</p>
			<p>The House of the Fourfold Path - both as a part of its nature and due to organizational entanglements - has an outstanding grudge with the Cult of the Cleansing Worm and unfortunately for them, the Ascendant Sovereign, as well as deep ties to the various partisan and resistance movements embedded inside the Empire of Vylmar.</p>
			<p>Helping out these resistance cells and sheltering political refugees is one of Neshu's main responsibilities in the House, and nearly three decades of witnessing the damage the Empire does firsthand has deeply embittered Neshu towards Vylmar.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion 1</h3>
			<p>A man walks into the bar.</p>
			<p>The man is human; tall and lean, with a pale countenance and silvery-black hair. He wears a stiff military uniform with a patch displaying the sigil of a coiling red dragon. A gold medal below it identifies the man as a Centurion of Vylmar - a commander of middling rank.</p>
			<p>A group of burly Jossinarians scowl at him as he passes by. One spits on the floor besides him, but the man pays her no mind. He walks to the countertop, his expression impassive, and sets the elegant steel saber he’s been carrying atop it.</p>
			<p>Of all the posts in the Empire, the man thinks as he studies the strange room, of course Augusta had to send him here, to this strange... place. It was so distant from the Vylmaran mainland, frequented with hostile barbarians and strange creatures, the likes of which even Vylmar’s archivists had not recorded before.</p>
			<p>Daekkan’s Hells, he didn’t even know exactly where he was. The outskirts of the Empire? A distant land? A distant world?</p>
			<p>The tavern, if it was truly one, seemed detached from everything else, adrift in a limbo of its own. Why had the Legate herself deemed this place so important to Imperial plans?</p>
			<p>It didn’t matter in the end. The orders were orders, and he had to follow them, whatever it took. How else could he rise in Imperial ranks?</p>
			<p>The man sighs and signals to the bartender, trying not to seem fazed by the strange being’s countenance.</p>
			<p>"Regalios bless you today, innkeeper," he says politely. "A medium beer, if you may."</p>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Vylmaran Empire</h3>
			<p>Of the three, Vylmar is certaintly the mightiest. The oldest and largest-spanning, the Empire reaches from the northern shore of Blackblood Bay to the southern river lands that make up the domain of House Vaexattor.</p>
			<p>Although Vylmar is technically ruled by its Empress, Alexandra III, it ironically has one of the weakest political systems internally. The Empress’ claim is uncertain after the last great rebellion against her House, and the other Great Houses squabble and scheme ever-constantly, dividing up the mighty imperium for their own gains. Perhaps that is why the other two have been able to withstand it.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Low 1</h3>
			<p>An elf walks, a little off-balance, into the bar and takes a look around, squinting at the automatons. If they're surprised, they don't show it. They wear dark green leather armor, but it's so worn that you can see a second layer of brown leather underneath. The various sticks in their hair don't seem intentional until a squirrel peeks out from it, but even then, the squirrel might not be intentional either. They have pallid skin and what little hue is in their eyes is green.</p>
			<p>"Ale," they tell the bartender, putting three unfamiliar copper coins on the table, "substandard."</p>
			<p>The bartender pauses for a moment, before going to pour a mug and ignoring the coins. The elf shrugs, and puts the coins back in their pocket before settling down and taking the drink.</p>
			<span class="annotation">
			<p>In truth, I was quite surprised when they asked me for my perspective. It’s not every day, after all, that an old enemy shows up from seemingly nowhere to make a deal with you.</p>
			<p>Though, I have to admit now, our enmity did fade after my employer and I broke ties.</p>
			<p>Ah, and even further more when they died.</p>
			</span>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Those of the Shadows</h3>
			<p>Beneath the exterior of this continent lies a fascinating and dangerous web of underground organizations. To understand the extent of what we see, we must look deep within in turn.</p>
			<p>It would not do justice to the narrative without mention of the Black Guilds. Old and powerful, they have roots in nearly every single nation on the planet - perhaps with more beyond. The Guilds number twelve in total, each specializing in their own unique dark art. I personally believe it to be rather dramatic - but knowing their founder, I can’t truly say it’s too surprising.</p>
			<p>But the Black Guilds are not the only force at work - quite far from it. I’d imagine you know of Neshu’s House of the Fourfold Path - and the various other similar occult organizations at work in the midst of it all, all caught in a tense sort of arcane rivalry. Dozens of smaller clans and gangs have risen in the underground as well, with the most commonly known faction other than the Guilds being the Zarian, which intends to fell the Black Guilds. Its attempts so far have been unsurprisingly rendered utterly futile.</p>
			<p>Alas, I must say that the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign exerts its influence in this space too, as it has done nearly everywhere else - but that is a matter we will not discuss now. I’d imagine it will come into question quite soon anyways.</p>
			<h3>Thedra 1</h3>
			<p>Nobody saw the door open, and no one heard it close. The bartender, engrossed in the preparation of a drink, didn’t notice the mug of ale go missing, but when it turned around, it did notice the two silver on the countertop, glistening like fragments of light from the very moon they were designed after.</p>
			<p>A certain elf, sitting alone at a table, reaches to take a sip from their mug, but before they can touch the drink, a metal claw with veins of purple energy running through it shoots out from seemingly nowhere, attached to a rope-like substance made of both plant and metal, snatches the ale, and returns to its owner, who happens to be sitting at an adjacent table, twenty feet away.</p>
			<p>As the plant-metal arm snakes its way back to this figure, the plain, simple robe - one so simple, in fact, that it looks as though this person had just draped a blanket over themselves, is cast aside in a dramatic motion.</p>
			<p>Underneath this "robe" lies a strange and - as I’m sure she would have said - stunning figure. Although she appears to be human, standing at around five and a half feet tall, so many alterations have by now been made to her warped body that "human" is most likely quite far from the truth.</p>
			<p>Though she has two normal human arms, instead of blood flowing through their veins, a strange glowing purple substance runs instead. Two other arms made of the vine-covered metal extend behind her, tipped with jagged claws.</p>
			<p>But the most striking part of her appearance is of course, her mask. Although seemingly made of normal steel, it melds to her facade like a second face, its silvery lips moving alongside her own and its iron eyes blinking naturally with her facial motions.</p>
			<p>Though the mask is clearly not natural in itself - what it hides - or rather does not; merely gives its purpose away further. Behind the mask, or perhaps within it, flows power - a pulsating, seemingly limitless strength that I now must admit has become simply too familiar by now.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Lich</h3>
			<p>Few from my time still live now, and those who deserve it are rare among them. Irivex is the worst of them all - and I must admit now, one of the primary reasons why I came here in the first place.</p>
			<p>To begin, it would be an understatement to call Irivex old. No-he is <i>ancient</i>, a being who came to the world when its population was barely a third of the size it is now. Here, on this backwater planet, he used the power he held to forge himself a truly mythical reputation; to some, becoming, quite ironically, the image of death itself.</p>
			<p>But in truth, Irivex is far from any god - especially one of such a thing as mortality. No; the true deities that I have known do not fear their own domains. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu 2</h3>
			<p>Neshu pays little noticeable mind to the first of the newcomers, though inside their mind is a whirling vortex. A Centurion. Here? Was there no place free from the dragon's gaze?</p>
			<p>Their thoughts are doused, however, as the priest, with a machine-like smoothness, moves their placid gaze towards the third newcomer.</p>
			<p>"Obscure Proverb: Accost not the Aunoctian within a bar, especially if a priest awaits in the wings. I doubt she is an Aunoctian, but I feel the message holds."</p>
			<p>And that sent the priest into a proper coughing fit.</p>
			<p>Thankfully, the clockwork bartender finally sets the extravagant cocktail in front of the priest, squeezing a few drops from a black bottle into the concoction. The drink, initially a dark and muddled red, transforms all at once into a bright, nigh-neon blue.</p>
			<p>The priest's voice sounds far more steady after they've taken down their first sip of the drink. Their gaze turns to the elf.</p>
			<p>"You have not introduced yourself. From whereforth have you come?"</p>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Approach of War</h3>
			<p>It is said that wherever power resides, unrest will follow. It is not only the Vylmaran imperium that lays claim to the continent-the kingdom of Hernan, led by its God-King Thailaik, and the city-states of the Jossic Federation, all seek to expand their own domains. With the decline of Vylmar, its rivals begin to encroach upon its control in turn - and the seeds of war are sown.</p>
			<p>It is this path, divided and squabbling amongst each other, that allows <i>others</i> to now take advantage of this state of disrepair and lay their own, even more ambitious, claims upon the world.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion 2</h3>
			<p>While waiting for his drink, the man scans the bar, noting its inhabitants. <i>What a strange place</i>, he thinks, his eyes passing over a plant-like humanoid being in one corner.</p>
			<p>He remembers Augusta’s words.</p>
			<p><i>Keep watch. The information that you will collect here is of the utmost importance. Study the barbarians - drink with them, dice with them. But remember your cause - stay vigilant. You will know when to leave.</i></p>
			<p>The man suddenly freezes at the sight of a robed tiefling near the back of the room, sitting besides an elf in a heavy cloak. Somehow, he recognizes them - although he doesn’t know exactly how.</p>
			<p>Reattaching his sword to his belt, he makes his way across the room, causing the strange mechanical bartender to turn towards him nervously. He stops by the tiefling’s table and smiles forcefully.</p>
			<p>"Do I know you?" he asks. "I believe I’ve seen you in the capital. A priest of Daekkan, I assume?"</p>
			<p>The priest takes another sip of their drink. When they speak again, their voice has regained yet more clarity.</p>
			<p>"Centurion. You would assume correctly. I've not seen you, however. I am Neshu, pas Aventaria. You?"</p>
			<p>The man nods. "I am Centurion Aurelion of the House Darax," he introduces himself. "It’s    always a welcome surprise to meet another resident of the Empire, isn’t it? Vylmarans should stick together more than ever, especially with Jossinar and Hernan preparing for war."</p>
			<p>He instinctively runs his fingers along the edge of his saber. "I’ve heard some truly worrying things lately. The dead stirring from their graves near the Skjaldan islands? A new God-King in Hernan?"</p>
			<p>He stops, letting the silence sink in.</p>
			<p>"And yet, what worries me most is this talk of internal rebellion. Worshippers of barbarian gods stirring up insurrections and strife? What a terrible thing to do, wouldn’t you agree? Heresy of the highest degree against the Empress and the Triumvirate itself."</p>
			<p>Although he doesn’t show it, Aurelion’s mind is abuzz with thoughts.</p>
			<p>Why was another Vylmaran here, in distant and foreign territory so far from the mainland. Conversing with barbarians, no less? Who were they truly - were they even who they claimed to be, or had his own memories failed him?</p>
			<p>They were troubling thoughts, and Aurelion decided that he needed to tread carefully. The right words could make a strong difference between a newfound ally and a dangerous enemy.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Gods of Vylmar</h3>
			<p>Once, when Vylmar was merely a small union of city-states bound by a common senate, Vylmarans worshipped a diverse pantheon of gods, deities of nature and the elements. Things have changed much since then, and after the nation’s first Emperor rose to power, many of the old gods were eradicated and erased from memory. Now, most Vylmarans only worship the Godly Triumvirate; the three gods Regalios, Vaellenia, and Daekkan.</p>
			<p>Regalios is the leader of the Triumvirate, the god of day, life, and creation. He’s heavily associated with the sun, as Vylmarans claim that the star contains Regalios’ Five Heavens, a heavenly paradise for those with the most merit.</p>
			<p>Vaellenia is Regalios’ sister and the god of dusk, dawn, and time. The stars are her realm, where spirits are judged before they go to her brothers’ afterlives.</p>
			<p>Daekkan, Regalios’ brother, reigns over death and the night. Daekkan’s domain is the moon, which contains his Five Hells, the cold and barren afterlife reserved for the worst of sinners and heretics.</p>
			<p>Although the Triumvirate is the only "accepted" religion in most of Vylmar, worship of the old gods of the stars, moon, and sun is still technically legal. Although it’s a practice frowned upon by the Vylmaran government, such deities are similar enough to the Triumvirate that they are effectively the same gods.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Low 2</h3>
			<p>The elf stares as the arm that took the mug lifts it up to her lips. The being tilts her head back and takes a long sip, after which she tosses the mug back in the elf’s direction.</p>
			<p>"Can’t you afford anything better than this?" she asks, in a soft, high-pitched voice, with a mild southern accent.</p>
			<p>You don't like it, get something yourself," replies the elf, face impassive. "and the best tastes the worst."</p>
			<p>In an obvious effort to maintain conversation, the human pushes herself away from the table she’s sitting at with her strange plant-arms, such that the elf is now facing her.</p>
			<p>"Your taste in ale could do better, then. Maybe I’m just spoiled - I’ve seen hundreds of these before - and I’d say I’m quite comfortable in all of them. As long as I get to talk to people and drink ale. If it’s good ale, not the stuff you were drinking." She gestures at the ale, now spilled on the floor.</p>
			<p>"Talking to people and drinking ale might be my two favorite things to do. What do you like doing? I mean, what do you do for a living? Gosh, I confuse the two so much, because I love what I do for a living, so I assume everyone else does too."</p>
			<p>This human is speaking incredibly quickly, such that her words are barely comprehensible. While she’s speaking, her numerous arms are doing various things - she is, for instance, with one of them, petting the squirrel in the elf’s hair.</p>
			<p>But even despite the almost imperceptible blur of movement that surrounds her, as the elf quickly notices, her eyes are intensely focused on him.</p>
			<p>The elf growls hostilely - and for more reasons than one.</p>
			<p>"Don't. Disturb. The squirrel." The squirrel seems undisturbed, and the elf looks at an unoccupied stretch of wall. "Seriously? You're going to let them touch you?"</p>
			<p>They turn around to see a mug of ale replaced on the counter. They take a short but large drink of it, before turning back to the pseudo-human.</p>
			<p>"And I'd really rather not converse with anyone, actually. Go ahead, take the squirrel, then at least it won't have the chance to ditch me on purpose."</p>
			<p>The last line is almost pointed in a strange way. Whatever the elf meant, however, seems to be lost to the other being.</p>
			<p>"Ooh, I get the squirrel?" she asks, tone apparently oblivious to the remark - whatever it truly was.  "I love being near alive things, thanks!"</p>
			<p>The pseudo-human reaches out an artificial arm to the squirrel, upon which the squirrel climbs rapidly, before climbing to rest on her shoulder.</p>
			<p>"Well, I’m tired, and I have a new friend that I gotta get to know better... Thedra out!"</p>
			<p>The human, who has made herself known as Thedra, slinks into the shadows, slowly stroking her squirrel with one of her artificial arms. The metal face of her mask contorts into a smile that doesn’t seem like it should fit on the face as she recedes away, revealing rows of pointed teeth.</p>
			<p>It’s clear that there’s most definitely something very wrong about her.</p>
			<p>The elf definitely recognizes this as well, and takes the opportunity of the centurion's questions as a distraction for the tiefling, slipping away quietly and casually. The tiefling doesn't notice; the centurion sees the elf stand and walk off, but only Thedra, watching the encounter, sees the elf sit down a few tables away before pulling out a deck of cards.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu 2</h3>
			<p>Neshu watches the proceedings with a wary interest.</p>
			<p>The elf pauses first, nearby. They've shuffled twice, and they were about to do so a third time - until this. They put away the deck of cards, and walk over quietly.</p>
			<p>"The graves of the Isles have opened again? I'd begun to hope, after two hundred years, that they might stay shut forever. But of course, Irivex is too ambitious for that, and I've no doubt Devarien is still right alongside him, defiling the peace of the dead, the traitor."</p>
			<p>The priest themself is outwardly placid, but their mind is abuzz as well.</p>
			<p>Humanity was never meant to hold the sheer breadth of memories Neshu must, and the priest has packed most of them away in constructs and implanted gemstones. After a moment of mental searching, Neshu finds what they were looking for, the context to that twinge of familiarity.</p>
			<p>The unlocked memory recounts to Neshu a confrontation with an imperial force some decade ago. The deep cowl couldn't hide all of their features, but Neshu had tried to ensure that none of the bloody dragons made it out of the manor alive anyway. Clearly, they had failed.</p>
			<p>Still, the Centurion doesn't look as if they recognize Neshu. Right?</p>
			<p>Neshu knows not the bar's rhyme or reason for allowing invitees, and for now has basically given up on trying to find it. Still, they've known many a mole or turncoat within the legions. Perhaps this Aurelion could be swayed as well.</p>
			<p>Whatever the case is, a new matter catches Neshu’s ear as the elf speaks, drawing far nearer to them than before. The first thing that Neshu thinks when they notice the elf walk over is that reality has begun to fray again. There's little evidence to support this, but there are very few creatures stealthy enough to evade the priest's notice, and Neshu has never heard of this elf before.</p>
			<p>The priest takes another sip of the elixir. Their voice is nearly completely hale, now, the chime tone speaking in an accent familiar to none.</p>
			<p>"Irivex stirs? Speak ye truly, elf, Irivex stirs? Centurion, I know you speak true: my flock is waning, as of late. Dark thoughts lie, waiting, in the hearts of passersby. But would I name heretics the merely misguided? They are but mortal, as us all. Young. Passionate."</p>
			<p>Another sip. The priest shivers slightly. Something dark enters their eyes.</p>
			<p>"A Lich is something else entirely. A creature so desperate to escape death that it threw its life away to continue a tortured existence. A fragility, born from and surviving on unfathomable suffering. Beyond heresy - an abomination."</p>
			<p>Neshu makes for their drink again - but it is finished. Their gaze, for just a moment, lingers on the empty cup. They move to speak, then pause, then move to speak again.</p>
			<p>"Still, dissidents are no laughing matter. There are no gods but the Three, no just rule but the Empress. Heresy is still a terrible thing. Which might then bring us to the subject of the 'God'-King."</p>
			<p>Neshu sees Aurelion initially smile in agreement, but the expression quickly fades. Instead, a strange look appears on his face in replacement, one that the priest can’t exactly discern. "These are dark things we speak of," he finally says. "Shall I buy you both drinks to lighten the mood?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion 3</h3>
			<p>Aurelion initially smiles in agreement with the strange priest’s words, but the expression quickly fades.</p>
			<p>Heresy.</p>
			<p>Even now, the memories are still vivid in his mind - almost as if the priest’s words refreshed them.</p>
			<p>The smell came first. The stench of burning flesh, of waves of deadly arcane magic ripping through men like a blade through soft butter. He remembered as soldiers stormed the manor’s gates, only to be repulsed by exploding fireballs and bolts of arcing lightning.</p>
			<p>An entire legion had tried to take the manor that day, defended by only fifteen of the House’s sorcerers. Of them, two had survived - and while Aurelion had remained a Centurion, Augusta had been promoted to the rank of Legate, assigned to a post in the capital.</p>
			<p>And now, here he was. In a place that didn’t truly exist, trying to find answers to a question he didn’t understand in the first place.</p>
			<p>"These are dark things we speak of," he says. "Shall I buy you both drinks to lighten the mood?"</p>
			<p>The elf abruptly intercuts him before Neshu can respond.</p>
			<p>So you want information," the elf responds. "You're not here because you want to be, or to meet people - you're just here to find out what you can. Don't pretend you didn't give yourself away with the offer."</p>
			<p>Aurelion tenses, gripping the hilt of his sword almost instinctively. He almost draws it before getting ahold of his senses, inhaling sharply.</p>
			<p>"Aren’t we all, in some way or another?" he replies, chuckling as if it was a jape. Despite his words, he doesn’t let go of the saber.</p>
			<p>He steps towards the elf and whispers, his voice so low that only the elf can hear it. "Bold, aren’t you? An admirable trait. Marcus Paenaron was also bold, before his rebellion was crushed in three days by Emperor Correl the Second. Sadly, his boldness did not prevent the deaths of six thousand men."</p>
			<p>Before the elf can respond, Aurelion takes a mug of beer from the bartender and hands it to him, turning around and leaving for a table in the center of the room.</p>
			<p>The elf writes a note before walking over to the table to say, "I'd be perfectly willing to exchange information."</p>
			<p>The elf quaffs the entire mug, dropping the piece of paper. It's written in common script, though a bit messy.</p>
			<p class="loh">Marcus' men slew five foes each with half the equipment, but that's irrelevant.</p>
			<p class="loh">I'd simply prefer if you were bold enough not to hide your intentions.</p>
			<p>In a whirl of motion that seems too fast to be real, Thedra is standing at Aurelion’s side, that sharp, huge grin still permeating her face.</p>
			<p>Her soft, high-pitched voice is entirely replaced by a deep rasp.</p>
			<p>"Now, what might give you the authority to make such claims? In some circles, you would be struck down in a second for words like that, your limbs scattered amongst the trees in the forest, and your organs fed to the wolves. You should know that Marcus Paenaron was burned at the stake."</p>
			<p>Returning to her deep rasp, "You. I don't believe I know you, and yet I feel that I should. After all, it seems that our goals are aligned."</p>
			<p>She then turns away and slinks back into the shadows. The perceptive notice, as she walks away, that one of her metal claws is stained with some red substance.</p>
			<p>The squirrel is nowhere in sight.</p>
			<p>The elf's face grows dark. "I fought Irivex with my own two hands and knives", they say, at a low volume but harsh tone, to nobody in particular, "and if you'd seen him, heard his voice, even just smelled his rank stench, you'd agree with each word I spoke."</p>
			<p>The elf makes a gesture, a sort of cutting motion with their second finger tucked under their thumb. Nobody else knows what it means.</p>
			<p>They walk off to sit back down, and pull their deck of cards back out.</p>

			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The House of Darax</h3>
			<p>Aurelion traces his lineage back to Leto Darax, a wealthy lord and leader of a Great House of Vylmar during the golden age of the Empire. Leto made the fateful mistake of siding with the rebel lords Marcus and later Darius Paeneron, who attempted to revolt against the Emperor in an attempt to bring back the senate of old. When the rebellion was eventually quenched by the Emperor, House Darax was stripped of their lands and vassals, soon becoming an insignificant player in the Empire’s politics. Although Leto’s ancestors have worked long and hard to gain their place back, even now, many still associate Darax as a house of traitors.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu 3</h3>
			<p>Neshu was silent for a very long time. Then, for the first since they had arrived, the priest rose from their stool. With each step accompanied by the rapping of their cane upon the ground, they approached the elf before melting into the seat opposite them.</p>
			<p>"A game of Leivas, perhaps?"</p>
			<p class="loh">Old Vylmaran Cant: A standard opening phrase, to indicate awareness of the cant.</p>
			<p>The elf shuffles three more times, unusually quickly.</p>
			<p>"I'd be willing, if the blue jay calls at seven and the fifth card's lost."</p>
			<p class="loh">Then-Modern Jossinarian Cant: A standard return phrase to accept the offered game; we should not continue if you are a member of the Zarian; I’m familiar with your opening, except for the fifth word.</p>
			<p>"Only my brothers and I, unfortunately. I only ever learned to play with the fifth, will that be an issue?"</p>
			<p class="loh">This is the only opener I know. Are you from an organization linked with mine?</p>
			<p>The elf seems to frown a bit.</p>
			<p>"Your deck's old, but no matter, and the fifth's a traveler, but I suppose I can play without. The crow sang at four, but my song's sleeping. I'm fine to play, but the guest deals, of course."</p>
			<p class="loh">Your codes are outdated, but I still understand them; your opening is still strange to me, but it doesn’t matter; I’m a member of the Order of the Blade, but I haven’t had contact with it for a long time. We can continue.</p>
			<p>The elf smirks again, though it's very unclear why.</p>
			<p>"Of course."</p>
			<p>Neshu takes the deck and deals straight - one card to themself, then one card to the elf, back and forth until each have a starting hand of six. Neshu is aware that dealing patterns aren't much of a thing anymore, and this is a message on the level of the game: Though Neshu is allowed to deal the cards from anywhere inside the deck, and in any order that they please, to deal straight is a sign of extreme confidence, whether real or bluffed. The priest here says either "I trust you" or "I do not need to trust you," it depends on context. Perhaps it is both.</p>
			<p>"I've always been partial to this game, though I don't get to play it often. The sleeping song sends shivers down my spine."</p>
			<p class="loh">My organization is on the periphery of the underground, which doesn’t deal directly with seedier enterprises, and you likely haven’t heard of it. I’ve not heard of your organization.</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				Typically, that first phrase would just be translated as "I’m part of a clean crew", but transcribing it as such is likely better for a typical populace. Plus, it’s about 270 years out of date, so it doesn’t really matter.
			</span>
			<p>"The crow sings far, but I've not heard further. What pitch shall this note be?"</p>
			<p class="loh">My organization is large enough that if you don’t know it, I probably don’t know yours. What topic shall we discuss?</p>
			<p>Before Neshu can respond, the door abruptly opens, sending a blast of cold air into the room. Low turns, intrigued, and Neshu follows in suit.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Xownfos 1</h3>
			<p>The door creaks slowly as a robed figure emerges.</p>
			<p>A kitsune woman with a singular white tail, long flowing white hair, and two tailed robe stands in the doorway as another gust of cold wind blows into the bar, bringing a flurry of snowflakes with it.</p>
			<p>Her eyes are covered by a veil that stands inside of the hood of her cloak. She stands a bit under six feet tall with a lithe build. The only feature that catches your eyes is the veil with a glyph stitched in gold onto the center.</p>
			<p>"This-," she pauses, "is not where I expected to turn up."</p>
			<p>Her hand moves to her waist as if ready to draw something from underneath her robe.</p>
			<p>"I knew the door was enchanted, but not with this powerful of a magic. Identify yourselves, I demand it..."</p>
			<p>Movement, impossibly fast movement, at the edge of the kitsune’s vision, and she feels a cold, metal claw on her shoulder.</p>
			<p>"I wouldn't try that," says the soft, light voice, "The force inside this bar, whatever it is, doesn't much like it when you try to attack people. I, however, am kind enough to introduce myself: I am Thedra."</p>
			<p>Another surge of movement, and the being calling herself Thedra is at the table where Low sits. The kitsune follows, intrigued.</p>
			<p>"I love watching people play," Thedra comments. " - so many different styles. They can really tell you a lot about a person." She smirks at those last words.</p>
			<p>The elf smirks in turn.</p>
			<p>"I see the Knave's opening used more and more frequently."</p>
			<p>Then, the elf, looking the pseudo-human dead in the mask's eyes, asks, "What song do you sing, then?"</p>
			<p class="loh">What organization are you a part of?</p>
			<p>The kitsune’s head tilts slightly at the notion of the power only retaliating against attacks, but her hand stays at her waist as she steps towards the table of cards.</p>
			<p>"Well met, Thedra. I am Xownfos of the Siannodel Guild. If you wouldn’t mind, please remove the law off my person. Still, if you aren’t trying to instigate anything why bother with the enchantment on the door? I’ve been through that door many times before, and it doesn’t normally lead to this-" she pauses again trying to come up with a name for the room, "-this pub."</p>
			<p>From nearby, Neshu turns towards her, expression curious. "She owns not the bar, Madam Xownfos-of-Siannodel. None here understand its enchantments, but, er, good job on the invitation? The machine," they say, pointing towards the giant clockwork apparatus behind the bar, "serves any drink. Would you care to join the Leivas table?"</p>
			<p>Xownfos nods. "I'd be glad to. But I must test this clock you tell of."</p>
			<p>With an outstretched hand, she waves to the machine. "An Icevein Concoction, if you mind." At the counter, one of the mechanisms nods in response and begins preparing.</p>
			<p>While she waits for the clock to respond, she turns back to Neshu. "By the way, I didn't catch your name. What should I address you as?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu 4</h3>
			<p>Despite what their appearance may have led you to believe, in truth, Neshu is no mage, at least not a traditional one. Their manasight can barely sense an active spell, let alone potentia. Their anima detection is better, all but the smallest meridians are galaxies in an otherwise black void, but by far the most developed world-sense of Neshu, pas Aventaria is their grafted attunement to the elements - or rather, the twelve that mask their identities as them.</p>
			<p>Neshu generally relies on attunement, but those other senses are not useless. Far from it. Thedra cannot hide a flare of magic, and Low cannot hide a flare in the soul. Also, the alcohol. Quite a tip-off, yes?</p>
			<p>For safety's sake, at least, the creature that calls itself Neshu sets a short mental timer and dumps all possible incriminating memories into the contingency crystal embedded deep inside their sternum. The priest is now one in truth, thirty-four years old and merely assisting the Capitoline Underground on occasion out of moral concerns.</p>
			<p>This rewrite isn't very thorough and will fall apart under basic scrutiny, but Neshu isn't the type to scrutinize themself, and it's not as if any invaders will be able to find the buried memories - they simply aren't there.</p>
			<p>Neshu takes a moment to mull something over in their head. "Bah", they think, "it's a bar setting. It matters not." Of course, the currently massive gaps in their memory and understanding of the world allow Neshu to miss the fact that the conventions they worry over are centuries out of date.</p>
			<p>"I am Neshu, pas Aventaria, Priest of Nightbrother Daekkan within the Imperial Seat. 'Tis nice to meet thee."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion 4</h3>
			<p>Aurelion barely notices the newcomer as he settles into the darkness of the room’s far corner. Partially covering himself with his cloak, Aurelion reaches into a hidden compartment within the robes and pulls out a small, circular metal device with a gemstone embedded into its surface. Aurelion puts a hand on the gem’s surface, and after a while, the device glows brightly and begins to beep, emanating a pale violet light.</p>
			<p>After a few seconds, the light coalesces into the figure of a tall woman in steel armor. Her face is scarred and she wears her hair in a small braid, her eyes a cold shade of deep gray.</p>
			<p>She turns to Aurelion, her expression almost surprised. "Centurion Aurelion. Have there been any issues with contacting me?"</p>
			<p>"There have not, Legate," Aurelion responds.</p>
			<p>"Good," Augusta replies calmly. "I spoke with Consul Vaexattor earlier this morning. He demands progress and information. What have you found?"</p>
			<p>"Not much yet, Legate," Aurelion begins. "But I believe I have found a clue to what we seek. Here, allow me. It is better if you see for yourself."</p>
			<p>Still trying to conceal himself, he holds the device upwards, shining the light in the direction of Neshu and Low.</p>
			<p>"Have you seen this ‘Neshu’ before? I have a suspicion that they know far more than they should."</p>
			<p>From the device, Augusta’s breath suddenly hisses through her teeth. She almost flinches and her eyes grow wide.</p>
			<p>"You suspect correctly, Centurion. They were there at the manor," the Legate says, breathing heavily. "I know it - I remember them. They tried to summon the construct on us."</p>
			<p>Aurelion exhales deeply. Could it be?</p>
			<p>"Are you sure?" he asks nervously. "Why would a member of the House be here?"</p>
			<p>"Whatever it is, they are exceedingly dangerous - as I am sure Consul Vaexattor recognizes as well. You must not let them leave the bar’s premises. We have been searching too long to let this opportunity escape us."</p>
			<p>"What should I do?" Aurelion asks, glancing towards the table where Neshu sits.</p>
			<p>"Whatever you must," Augusta instructs. "Stall for time, preferably. And if all goes wrong, kill them."</p>
			<p>Aurelion nods, studying the tiefling worriedly. "With all respect, are you sure this is a wise course of action? They seem... quite dangerous."</p>
			<p>"Then simply buy us time," Augusta decides. "I will send you reinforcements if necessary."</p>
			<p>"I’m not sure if any ordinary soldiers could suffice here," Aurelion muses. "There are several other beings in the bar, each seemingly very powerful."</p>
			<p>Augusta’s figure stops, resting a hand on her chin.</p>
			<p>"Will a Praetorian serve?" she eventually asks. Her eyes flicker over the bar, calculating.</p>
			<p>Aurelion feels a chill run up his spine. "Yes... I believe one will take care of the situation quite well. Just... do not let it become too messy."</p>
			<p>Augusta smiles grimly. "I believe your request isn’t much of an option when it comes to the Praetorian."</p>
			<p>Aurelion shivers. <i>A Praetorian? Here?</i> It seemed that Augusta was ready to take any measure possible, no matter how decisive they could be.</p>
			<p>"My actions are giving away too much right now," he says. "I will speak to you later."</p>
			<p>"Very well," the Legate responds, her tone still uncertain. "Contact me if anything else happens."</p>
			<p>The image flickers away and disappears, leaving Aurelion alone with the device. But before the Centurion can put it away, Neshu suddenly seems to notice him. Their eyes widen in realization.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Ranks of the Empire</h3>
			<p>As befits most large civilizations, the Vylmaran Empire’s, despite what it may seem, structure is one of the most disjointed on its very continent.</p>
			<p>Though the Empress Alexandra rules in name, it is her council that holds the key to her power. Her consuls, from the most powerful few Great Houses - Vaexattor, Rennain, Alharon, and Carador, each hold almost as much power as her own. These Houses each govern their own sector of the Empire and its capital, cities that often rival the Imperial Seat itself in wealth and influence.</p>
			<p>The Imperial army shares this same structure, being rather than controlled directly by the Empress, made up of various legions each contributed by a Great House. Thus, the Imperial Consuls have taken to each amassing as many as possible in preparation for the coming storm. Unsurprisingly, Vaexattor is in the lead.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Low 4</h3>
			<p>Thedra stares into their eyes. Five seconds pass. Ten.</p>
			<p>Thedra's eyes widen. She staggers back.</p>
			<p>"Y-You."</p>
			<p>She raises a trembling human arm, bringing it up to point it at the elf.</p>
			<p>"You shouldn’t be here."</p>
			<p>In the elf’s sight, which begins to blur and warp before him, the lights of the bar start flickering, and Thedra's metal mask melts away to reveal a horrific visage, with her mouth locked in a face-wide grin and the eyes seemingly gouged out, dripping with some black liquid. The claws, both of which now seem to be bloodstained, start extending toward the elf.</p>
			<p>"I don't know how, by the gods above and below, you got out of Irivex’s hands but you sure as hell won't-"</p>
			<p>Thedra is cut off as the shadows stir and a <b>force</b> moves from the beyond to block her. All goes black-</p>
			<p>-and the scene cuts back to normal.</p>
			<p>The force is gone, the lights are no longer flickering, and Thedra's mask is back, a single drop of black liquid dropping to the floor from its surface.</p>
			<p>"My apologies," she says to the elf, back in her normal voice, "I got a bit carried away there. I was just... surprised that your previous statement held truth. Not many fight Irivex and live to tell the tale."</p>
			<p>"My tune is with the One Below, of course - who else?"</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				This is the most broken cant I’ve ever heard in my life. I still don’t even fully know now what she was trying to say.
			</span>
			<p>In response, the elf puts their cards face down on the table and stands.</p>
			<p>"I am called Low. I'm not surprised that Devarien decided to cut me out of the story. I don't intend to describe my survival, lest it prevent another's."</p>
			<p>It was clear that she had searched his brain. Lohlethean had learned self-deception a long time ago, but it took effort. He was on guard now - he didn't know how much she had learned, but he could make some assumptions. Not yet, however. Not yet.</p>
			<p>They'll kill you.</p>
			<p>He'd known for a long time that he was probably insane. He was good at hiding it, and it was generally manageable.</p>
			<p>You'll have to kill them first.</p>
			<p>No, they can be useful yet.</p>
			<p>No, they're too danger-</p>
			<p>Even the maniacal voices in his head argued with each other. It had started back then, he thought. Back when the traitor revealed her nature.</p>
			<p>Kill it! It knows too-</p>
			<p>Shut up.</p>
			<p>That usually didn't work, but it never hurt to try. It had been a long time since those voices had cooperated, and even longer since they'd said anything helpful.</p>
			<p>But the tiefling... they were interesting. Their cant had been several hundred years old, and they'd dealt straight. Lohlethean began to recall the... not now. Not with the halflife. At least he'd... not that.</p>
			<p>His thoughts were scattering. Bad. Penguins. Could the halflife have forged a link? He searched his mind.</p>
			<p>Screams. More screams. Deeper. Screams, screams, screams, further down, screams, screams. Screams, screams... blackness.</p>
			<p>And beyond that, where even he no longer did not dare go...</p>
			<p>He could always go there, when the voices had gotten too loud at night. They were always worse at night. Not now. No, there was just a crack left, from the puncture. He could seal that up. And now he knew what to watch for.</p>
			<p>Done.</p>
			<p>At least he didn't have to endure the screams on the way up, even if everyone had just watched him stare blankly into nothingness for... however long.</p>
			<p>Lohlothean turned to the bartender. "A shot of the strongest you've got." Alcohol pushed the voices away.</p>
			<p>A glass on the counter. He downed it all at once, and it burned in his throat.</p>
			<p>He'd always wondered why psychologically influencing poison stopped the voices. It made more sense for it to make them worse, but he didn't really need a reason. Nothing made much sense anymore.</p>
			<p>He turned back to the halflife and the tiefling.</p>
			<p>"Sorry, where were we?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu 4</h3>
			<p>Neshu turns, only to blink and face back towards the table. Whatever they had formerly believed vanishes from thought within a moment - as if the memory had been tucked away in an instant.</p>
			<p>Nearby, the soldier Aurelion seems to suddenly relax - though Neshu no longer suspects why.</p>
			<p>He rises from his seat and approaches Neshu, studying them cautiously. "So you are a priest of the Nightbrother? Where is the temple you serve at?"</p>
			<p>Alas, Neshu is so very incredibly confused. About the only thing they could twig to inside of the most recent conversation was Aurelion’s question, but the priest's mind is too clouded and empty to know just exactly why.</p>
			<p>So like any good cover, what Neshu - clad in the robes of the clergy - speaks now is the truth. Like any great cover, not even Neshu now knows it to be one.</p>
			<p>"I am a custodian of the Reliquary of Ten Thousand Stars, and the priest-at-service inside of the Temple's calendar rituals. I also help with outreach to the populace, on occasion."</p>
			<p>Besides them, Xownfos takes notice of Aurelion's relaxed posture, and seems to relax a bit more as well, standing straight and taking her hand out from under her cloak. "I get the feeling that everyone here is very, very on edge. Why don't all of you talk about your feelings together? Or at least agree to put international conflicts away from each other? Political views only bring tension to polite conversation."</p>
			<p>"Feelings," says Low, shifting in his spot, "have never been very interesting to me, and I've never been one for politics either. I prefer practical conversation to both."</p>
			<p>He gestures to Neshu. "I believe it is your turn."</p>
			<p>"Perfect!" says the priest, still utterly oblivious. "But first, any final patrons who wish to be dealt in? It'll be far less convenient to enter once the game begins."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor’s Notes: The Praetorian Order</h3>
			<p>The Praetorian is an elite and secretive order of Imperial soldiers who carry out covert missions for high-ranking Vylmaran authorities.</p>
			<p>Members of the Order operate a wide variety of jobs, serving as assassins, spies, and bodyguards for the Empress and her consuls.</p>
			<p>The Praetorian are also high priests of Daekkan, from whom they supposedly gain their strange abilities. With bodies enchanted by powerful arcane magic, a member of the Order has drastically increased strength, speed, and stamina, as well as incredible amounts of endurance and healing. Although such rumors are widely considered to be myth, some even say the Praetorian have control over shadow itself, being able to supposedly vanish from sight on command and change their appearance with illusory magic.</p>
			<p>Though I must confirm these statements to be to a degree, true, their origin is certainly less divine than many believe.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Luthan 1</h3>
			<p>At once, a door materializes and is thrown open by a man flourishing an oddly shaped sword. A dark cloak sits loosely on his shoulders above a threadbare robe woven hastily of a fabric that seems colored vibrantly by its nature. The robe is lashed by a strange belt carrying even stranger artifacts. Despite his haphazard and otherworldly attire, he seems in good condition, and his eyes seem to burn with adrenaline as he thrusts the sword forward.</p>
			<p>As the other residents of the bar turn towards him in slight shock, several expressions dance across his face: first realization, then frustration, anger, and curiosity. He sheaths his blade and opens his mouth to ask a question but quickly shuts it, not wanting to make a worse impression for himself.</p>
			<p>He wraps his robe about him, and gives an assortment of coins to the barkeeper, mumbling "get me something unique." The bartender freezes for a moment, trying to process why this dark figure had given it units from at least eight different currencies, only two of which it had ever seen. Instead, it simply leaves them on the counter, and without requesting anything useful in return, begins to prepare something for the man, who had walked to the far corner of the bar and stood there, silent and unconcerned.</p>
			<p>Yet his solitude is soon disturbed as Thedra launches herself from the table, retaining her ungodly speed, and flies in the direction of this newcomer. She lands besides him, arms retracting ever so slightly into her frame.</p>
			<p>"A newcomer! From where do you hail? What is your name? You simply must tell me everything."</p>
			<p>The man removes his hood, intrigued by the peculiar figure.</p>
			<p>"My name depends on who you ask," he says. "I like to call myself Luthan, a name I must have picked up... somewhere...  While the door here may have appeared at a most inconvenient time for me, I am not surprised by it - these things happen often to me. I guess you could call me some kind of interplanetary nomad - I take whatever passages appear in the void between worlds and see what I can learn. Perhaps my interruption was a blessing in disguise. What do you know of this place?"</p>
			<p>Xownfos walks over to Luthan and bows slightly, in a polite manner. "Welcome, Luthan. If you're looking for information, you'd best talk to Neshu. They seem to be the most comfortable with this place. However, the clock over there serves some excellent beverages. Fortunately - or perhaps unfortunately, no poison, but most other liquids."</p>
			<p>Luthan is signaled by the mechanical bartender and takes his first glass of some odd Jossinarian ale. Taking a sip, his eyes immediately widen with surprise, familiarity. He keeps this look of shock as he sets the glass down on the counter louder than he intended, and walks to Neshu. "Where... well, no. This tavern seems to transcend space. Well then... from where did you arrive here? And how?"</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan walked through the streets of a bustling bazaar, his cloak wrapped around him. Though the streams of people and shouts of sellers should have made him hard to find, he sensed his enemy and knew they sensed him too.</p>
			<p>Out of options, he ducked into a dark alley and pulled from his belt a vial of black liquid. He shook it roughly, causing the liquid to begin to glow with a dim light.</p>
			<p>Conveniently, it turned out just bright enough for him to find a trapdoor at the end of the path. As was typical in such a market, the many thieves that frequented it needed their places to hide.</p>
			<p>As Luthan opened the hatch, he heard the unsheathing of a sword behind him. He turned around to see his foe, clad in obscuring black robes, holding a shimmering curved blade trailing threads of magic, to his face. In the air behind him, visible to only his eyes, shone a faint magical projection - the image of a golden shield adorned with two white wings.</p>
			<p>"There you are, miscreant. Stand down and stop this madness. You unravel our plans by solely being here."</p>
			<p>Luthan set his hand on his blade. "You have no right to interfere."</p>
			<p>He ducked and rolled behind his adversary, drawing his weapon at the same time, blocking their blow as they whirled around to stop him.</p>
			<p>"I grow weary of your hypocrisy," he said as he began a vigorous duel with the dark figure. In response, they only gritted their teeth beneath their featureless mask, advancing once more.</p>
			<p>"The Warden never had the strength you claim it does," he taunted, slashing rapidly. The figure parried a few blows before retreating once more.</p>
			<p>"You claim to resist the Sovereign, but what do you do to prove it?"</p>
			<p>"You only derail things further," they responded. "Your recklessness will bring an end to us-"</p>
			<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity, Luthan leapt forwards in a whirlwind of motion and brought his sword to his opponent’s chest, edging it closer as they began to breathe heavily.</p>
			<p>"I believe you should be the one to stand down now."</p>
			<p>His opponent, realizing this, jumped gracefully backwards into the passage beneath the trapdoor.</p>
			<p>A strange light flashed from beneath their cloak and they vanished beneath in a sudden burst of speed.</p>
			<p>Luthan gave chase, only wanting an end to the pursuit. He followed his enemy through the labyrinth of winding tunnels below, approaching what he could sense to be a dead end. One more turn, and they would be cornered... the moment his rival turned and slammed the door behind them, Luthan brandished his sword for the final battle, and burst into the Backways Bar.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Planeshifting</h3>
			<p>Planeshifting is fundamentally simple - it’s the exploitation of flaws.</p>
			<p>Flaws are what differentiates nature from machinery - countless tiny differences that ultimately add up to a new identity. Without these flaws, without evolution and learning, we would never be in the same place as we are now.</p>
			<p>Planeshifting works that same way - a happy accident, built on the ultimately flawed concept of space in the Greater Plane.</p>
			<p>There are two main types of planeshifting, both allowing you to instantly transport yourself and nearby objects between points on the Greater Plane.</p>
			<p>The traditional form of interplanar travel is known as fixed planeshifting; it’s how the Bar operates. Fixed planeshifting is well, fixed by the will of the Greater Plane, unable to be controlled by the planeshifter. This form of travel is notably difficult to utilize, as planeshifters who use this will have to either search for gateways for long durations of time or hope they’re lucky enough to find one by complete happenstance. Common examples of this manifest in the shape of strange doorways, caverns, and for some reason, wardrobes and other such large pieces of furniture.</p>
			<p>More recently, however, the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign and a few other powerful interplanetary organizations have gained control over a new form of interplanar travel; what’s now known as instantaneous planeshifting.</p>
			<p>This form of planeshifting is portable and able to be, in its essence, controlled by the planeshifter.</p>
			<p>Instantaneous planeshifting first requires an interplanar key, a device that can consume energy in order to manipulate spatial boundaries. While many would say this is a significant upgrade from the alternative - there’s a catch. Such devices have limited capacity - they can only "remember," or so to speak, a limited amount of locations - to contain so much data in such a small vessel would be essentially impossible. Even the most renowned planeshifters are limited to this constraint - and progress towards finding a way to remove this barrier have only proven even more futile.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Xownfos 2</h3>
			<p>Xownfos chuckles at the mention of practical conversation.</p>
			<p>"But practicality can't get you everywhere, can it? Connotation is everywhere if you look for it. No one ever says exactly what they mean."</p>
			<p>With a wave of her hand, a chair flies through the room and lands near Neshu's table. "If it's not too much trouble, I'd be interested in playing. I quite enjoyed the card games I tried on the rare occasions I had people to play with. What did you say this game was called again?"</p>
			<p>"Leivas," responds Low. "What song do you sing?"</p>
			<p>"Leivas, you say? It rings a bell, but I can't quite put my hand on it. I suppose I'll try my hand at it. As for singing, I'd consider myself less of a singer and more of a musician, but I do occasionally sing on request. However, I am quite proficient with the flute." </p>
			<p>She leans in towards Low and whispers.</p>
			<p>"You best not advertise your involvement with Jossinarian thieves to everyone. Some might not enjoy your presence. I've seen it first hand."</p>
			<p>Sitting back upright, she continues, "I could care less though. After all, the Jossic have done quite a bit of business with my guild."</p>
			<p>Low smirks.</p>
			<p>"The cant's not very useful at this point anyways, I suppose. I'm not well known, except in my own circles. Perhaps we should see who really cares - I'm not as Low as I am."</p>
			<p>He slowly stands up, and looks around, taking stock of the room once more, briefly. The trader. The priest. The halflife. The conqueror. The planeshifter. And me.</p>
			<p>"I am, in truth, the only One Low the Low One, Founder and Shadow of the Order of the Blade, the final Black Guild. I fought against the lich Irivex, alongside Devarien the Oathbreaker before that was her name, and I survived her betrayal. I am the one who Sees With Shadows, the Madman of Selbrakir, the Elf who Spites the Moon. I am the Consort of Dragons and the Friend of the Rangers, bearer of the Summer Armor and the wielder of the Autumn Knife. I have survived the unsurvivable, escaped the inescapable, and broken the unbreakable. I am the Forsaken Rogue, the Forgotten None, the Arcane Without Mana, the Challenger of Bindings, and though I am also called the Honest Liar, every claim I have made is legitimate, and if you were to ask I could indeed recount some of my tales, though most are centuries old."</p>
			<p>For a moment, the entire room grows dimmer and a bit warmer. The effect fades quickly, and Lohlethean turns back to Xownfos.</p>
			<p>"Unless I've missed a stray pawn or rook, I believe that's checkmate. Will you be playing in this game of Leivas, or should the priest take their turn?"</p>
			<p>Another wave of cold winds wash over Low as Xonwfos tilts her head and replies.</p>
			<p>"You needn't checkmate me," she says. I'd resigned long before the match had begun. But yes, I remember your name. Your attire seemed familiar. However, if you would, explain your title of Honest Liar for me? I've not heard of that one in particular."</p>
			<p>She turns to Neshu. "Another round, perhaps?"</p>
			<p>Promptly, the priest deals Xownfos in, this time using an Ultaric cut. Both Xownfos and Low turn their heads - though the priest doesn’t recognize it, card tricks like the extravagant cut they just performed usually took years of training to master. </p>
			<p>"Ah," Low answers, facing back and smirking slightly. "The title of the Honest Liar. There are some who cannot lie, and yet remain dishonest - fey as an excellent example. I lie, and yet remain honest; for example, telling someone that I will steal from them before proceeding not to."</p>
			<p>Xownfos nods.</p>
			<p>"As I've mentioned, I've seen people killed for using thieves' cant. It's quite humorous actually, I believe I once was ordered to try to assassinate you. How small the world is."</p>
			<p>She reaches under her cloak into a pocket and pulls out a small crystal. "Do not misunderstand, you clearly outclass me in rank and power, and this warrant was issued by a corrupt and complacent noble, whose funds I am still draining under the facade of chasing you down." She powers on the crystal, and a notebook made of pure mana appears. She flips through the now tangible pages, eventually seeming to find what she was looking for. Handing the crystal to you, she points to a letter from an Imperial nobleman. "This fool has been handing me a stream of funds for the past three months in hope that I'll by chance happen upon a chance to kill you - or perhaps the one you serve, in cold blood."</p>

			<h3>Proprietor’s Notes: On the Yarashe Tongue</h3>
			<p>"Neshu, pas Aventaria." That last bit is a Callname, and roughly translates to "The gatekeeper who prevents the advance of sunset through unwavering faith." It's a piece of poetic irony for a Lunar Priest, and a small nod to Neshu's true affiliation.</p>
			<p>A tongue favored for the more fickle spellcastings, Yarashe is the common language of, funnily enough, most beings who masquerade as celestial entities. Its density of information is such that even High Talemnian weeps, and its most legendary speakers have given lengthy sermons, teachings, and commands in but a single syllable.</p>
			<p>A famous example is the command "KAJ," given by the Bladelord Obath-Jar to his apprentice upon his final death. To this day, the Followers of the Bladelord still ceaselessly work to understand the thousands of subtleties it encodes. No mortal creature can natively speak it, and very few can reach such levels of efficient mastery.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, a monk, priest, or other scholar of Yarashe will dedicate some years of their life to meditating on and composing a Callname, a philosophical statement of identity and intent. Using an ancient, non-binding ritual, they will then graft it to their truest name. Callnames are accepted as surnames in most nations, should the user lack a pre-existing one.</p>
			<p>Personally, I see little point in usage of the tongue myself, but alas, there must be some incentive behind it if those who speak it are so often believed to be divine.</p>
			<p>After all, I’d imagine the true gods I know would laugh at the notion of such a preposterous thing. That is, if they had anything remotely resembling mouths in the first place.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Thedra 2</h3>
			<p>Thedra's eyes widen to impossible sizes as she hears some words spoken in the conversation behind her.</p>
			<p>"Excuse me. I'll be in a moment."</p>
			<p>She shoots herself over to "Low" as he speaks.</p>
			<p>"Unless I've missed a stray pawn or rook," the elf is saying to the kitsune woman, "I believe that's checkmate. Will you be playing in this game of Leivas, or should the priest take their turn?"</p>
			<p>"Well, that would make sense," Thedra intercuts. "Devarien always was a strong one. I suppose you hid in the shadows while the woman a thousand times your honour fought Irivex?"</p>
			<p>She breathes and continues.</p>
			<p>"Anyway, I have, in fact, heard of some of your titles. You know, some say they’re simply used as glue to patch a shattered ego."</p>
			<p>Low’s expression is grim as he responds, staring at Thedra without a single movement.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps you'd like to know how that night played out?" he finally says, his voice suddenly rising.</p>
			<p>"After pressing through his armies, Irivex made an offer to both of us. Eternity with power in return for allegiance. I refused, and so naturally, Devarien shot me on the spot, and made the bolt smiting. It caused me one permanent injury, and the two of them left me to die of an agonizing wound. And as for the jab about my many names, I never asked for them, and really, elves generally have frustratingly resilient egos. If mine is shattered as you say, it's probably too damaged for any glue to help."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion 5</h3>
			<p>Aurelion rises from his seat, sensing an opportunity.</p>
			<p>"Let me refill our glasses," Aurelion decides. "I‘ll pay for us all."</p>
			<p>Before anyone can say otherwise, Aurelion takes the glasses and gives them to the bartender, placing a handful of copper coins on the table. As the bartender moves to refill the drinks, Aurelion takes the communication device out of his cloak and moves out of earshot.</p>
			<p>As he activates the machine, he quickly makes sure that nobody is nearby. His eyes fall on Xownfos first. While he doesn’t believe that the kitsune is a threat, she seems to know far too much to be harmless. As with most of the bar’s guests, Aurelion believes that he should tread carefully in his dealings with her.</p>
			<p>Augusta’s figure manifests in a burst of light atop the device, turning to face him.</p>
			<p>"Has all gone well?" she asks. "You have not been compromised?"</p>
			<p>"They don’t seem to notice," Aurelion answers. "I believe we can carry on."</p>
			<p>Augusta nods. "The Praetorian is in place, with a squadron of mages arriving later as reinforcements. The trap is sprung."</p>
			<p>Aurelion inspects the room once more, keeping a steady eye on Neshu. "What do want me to do next? Do you believe the bar’s defenses can be broken?"</p>
			<p>Augusta is silent. "It could be possible... and yet, I believe an attempt to be too time-consuming. Better yet to lure the target outside and into the hands of the Praetorian."</p>
			<p>"How do you want me to proceed?" Aurelion asks. "I doubt they trust me enough."</p>
			<p>"Then gain that trust," Augusta instructs. "Act oblivious - perhaps buy them some drinks and act friendly. I am sure you will know what to do when the time comes."</p>
			<p>Aurelion is silent. "I will - but there’s one thing I have to ask you first."</p>
			<p>"Yes?" Augusta asks, tilting her head.</p>
			<p>"What will you do with them? I do understand your concern, but what if the suspect is innocent? While I was speaking to them, I couldn’t detect a single trace of nervousness - their speech and body language were completely normal. Could we possibly be looking for the wrong person?"</p>
			<p>Augusta sighs, her voice trailing away. "Are you sure you are out of earshot?"</p>
			<p>Aurelion nods. "Yes? Why?"</p>
			<p>"It is time you learned of your purpose in coming here," the Legate says. "You have remained in ignorance long enough."</p>
			<p>Although Aurelion’s expression is impassive, his eyes are eager. Was it finally time to find some answers at last?</p>
			<p>"You have come here following a lead - one of utmost importance to the safety of the Empire. You see, three years ago, one of our most trusted spies informed us of a plan circulating deep in the city’s underground, detailing a potential heist on the Capitol Vault. Fortunately, we stopped the heist long before it could be enacted, arresting and interrogating most of the criminals involved. What we found, however, had a far greater impact than a simple heist. The thieves had ties to a massive, coordinated rebel movement, one spanning eight different cities and incriminating over thirty different influential figures. We traced each of them down - and this ‘Neshu’ seemed to be one of the deepest links, as the organization they work for supposedly led to the very core of the rebellion itself. After eight years of interrogating, arresting, and spying, we finally managed to discover another solid lead; the name of a place that Neshu frequented. It is why you are here now."</p>
			<p>Augusta stops, and Aurelion gazes at her with wide eyes.</p>
			<p>He couldn’t believe it. He had been the one chosen to do this?</p>
			<p>"You may think that we have drifted apart over time, but you are wrong. I recommended you to Consul Vaexattor, telling him of your exploits in the Arvec campaigns. You have a chance, here and now, to prove your worth-to prove the worth of House Darax. Do not disappoint me."</p>
			<p>Before he can respond, Augusta disappears, leaving him alone. He sits there, mouth agape, for several seconds, as if just processing the information.</p>
			<p>Augusta still cared about him. He had a chance to redeem himself, even after so long.</p>
			<p>Aurelion bows respectfully to the device, his hands shaking on the hilt of his sword.</p>
			<p>He had been issued orders.</p>
			<p>He would not disappoint.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor’s Notes: House Vaexattor</h3>
			<p>Of the Great Houses of Vylmar, House Vaexattor is the oldest, most prestigious - and now, considered the most powerful.</p>
			<p>The Vaexattor motto is "Val Vrago Anaraeth," a Yarashe phrase roughly translating to "The dragon’s heart burns bright with the flames of courage."</p>
			<p>The motto has held true since the House’s ancient origins, a time predating the Empire itself. The Vaexattors are widely known across Vylmar for their legendary exploits, one of the most famous being Julius Vaexattor’s fight and subsequent triumph over the Terror General Ixilscor.</p>
			<p>In fact, many say that the Vaexattors are more akin to angels than men, the distant descendants of celestial beings. And when one takes into consideration the ethereal appearance and luminous glow direct Vaexattor descendants have, such theories do not seem too far from the truth.</p>
			<p>The current head of the Great House is Daerius Vaexattor, one of the five Imperial Consuls and the Empress’ personal spymaster.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu 5</h3>
			<p>At the table, Neshu rises to respond to Luthan’s statement.</p>
			<p>"A door," they say, "picked generally at random, to one of the many storage rooms of the reliquary building. I've already spoken at length on this - and I'd ask the same question to you."</p>
			<p>Turning back to the table, Neshu falls back into the role of dealer with instinctual ease.</p>
			<p>"It looks as if all who wish to play have been dealt in! Trump suit this round is..." Neshu sets down one of their cards "...lamps. We will play forward, beginning with Low. The game has now begun."</p>
			<p>The planeshifter nods, gaze locked upon the game as they sit nearby. "...I came through mid-chase from the city of Aruzi in... well, you wouldn't recognize it anyway. I don't know all that much about it either... I just come and go, after all. It's an interesting life, to see much but master nothing."</p>
			<p>Luthan seems to trail off, and returns his gaze to study the brew in front of him on the counter.</p>
			<p>Besides him, the elf Low bites his lips. "There’s no point in stalling, is there? He pauses, and then plays a goblet. "Shattering glass."</p>
			<p>"Ahh... foiled," Xownfos replies. "Might as well shoot my foot earlier than later."</p>
			<p>She plays a spear, and promptly draws a card afterwards.</p>
			<p>Low, expression indiscernible, plays a coin from his hand.</p>
			<p>Neshu, lacking the cards to keep their plan up, breaks the chain early. They draw a card before playing a coin.</p>
			<p>"Ante."</p>
			<p>Low plays another coin.</p>
			<p>"Leivas, savagery."</p>
			<p>Without a coin, Xownfos plays another spear and draws a new card in turn.</p>
			<p>"Drawing a poor hand, I see."</p>
			<p>Low smiles, drawing no card. "Unfortunately not."</p>
			<p>Xownfos looks to the other members of the table.</p>
			<p>"By the way, Neshu, I haven't heard your story of discovering the bar. Would you mind sharing with us?"</p>
			<p>"Leivas," Neshu prefaces. "Of course not. Alas, I lack a particularly dramatic story. T'was a month or two ago when I found this place. I had been sweeping the back rooms of the reliquary when a door unexpectedly opened here A few times since then have I returned, but this is my first seeing anyone else."</p>
			<p>Low plays a lamp.</p>
			<p>He takes another glance around the room, but says nothing.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Backways Bar</h3>
			<p>As Neshu and the others play, Aurelion makes his way to the counter. He’s filled their glasses nearly to the brim with Sjkaldan beer, a concoction notable for its extremely strong smell and distinct taste. After briefly making sure that nobody noticed, in a flash of sudden movement, Aurelion passes his hand over the mug and drops what seems to be several grains of colorful material into the largest drink-a knowledgeable botanist would recognize it as Duskpollen, a tasteless, near-odorless poison that can kill within seconds when consumed in large quantities.</p>
			<p>Fortunately for Neshu, Aurelion doesn’t want to kill them - at least not just yet. The few grains of Duskpollen now in the drink are only capable of dazing and fatiguing the consumer for a couple of hours, causing their thoughts to muddle.</p>
			<p>Aurelion hands the glass containing the poison to Neshu and slides the others to Low and Xownfos, respectively. The poison has completely mixed into the drink, and combined with the beer’s smell, is effectively undetectable.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan looks around the bar, watching intently as the game of Leivas goes on. His travels have made him a fast learner, and while the cryptic verbal cues confuse him, he at least picks up the objective of emptying the hand, and notices the elf is winning. He sees a swift movement out of the corner of his eye to see Aurelion’s hand suspiciously move away from a mug next to him. It cannot be good.</p>
			<p>Though now even more skeptical of the soldier’s intentions, he stands silently as the drinks are passed out to the players. He puts his hand on his belt of otherworldly trinkets, not feeling for anything in particular but trying to think of a quick response to what he is afraid might happen next. His fingers finding an engraved stone, some sort of defensive charm, he whips it out as Neshu reaches for the drink, only for its dark surface to glow brightly with the sigil of the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign.</p>
			<p>The flash of movement immediately draws Low's attention. He finds the centurion sliding a mug towards him - the person from whom the movement came.</p>
			<p>Skjaldan beer.</p>
			<p>Strong smell, strong taste... combined with trust issues, Low's mind goes quickly to poison. He could probably identify it if he could see it alone, but he doesn't really need to.</p>
			<p><i>Kill him! Kill him, you idiot, he wants you dead!</i></p>
			<p>Eh.</p>
			<p>Something... changes. Observant characters would likely notice Low seem to grow dim briefly, as if the lights had flickered, but only for him.</p>
			<p>"I haven't had this in a while. I don't remember liking it, but tastes can change with time. I might see if those bot bartenders serve any kind of food after this game; liquid doesn't go well with empty stomachs."</p>
			<p>He looks Aurelion dead in the eye with a bit of a cold look.</p>
			<p>"No harm in trying things a second time."</p>
			<p>Low gradually drinks the entire mug.</p>
			<p>"Ugh. Now I remember why I haven't tried it for fifty years."</p>
			<p>He pulls a flask of completely black fluid from... somewhere? and takes a drink from it. He flickers dim again.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Aurelion sees Low’s eyes light up with realization and nods towards him, motioning for the elf to follow him to the countertop.</p>
			<p>"I’d like to apologize for the secrecy. After all, what is more pure than a simple truth?"</p>
			<p>He lowers his voice to a whisper.</p>
			<p>"I do not intend to kill them. I mean no harm to any of you, even the one that I seek. What I seek is cooperation - the mutual exchange of truths.</p>
			<p>I know that you fight Irivex, elf, you have said so yourself. I believe you; you clearly bear great power.</p>
			<p>And yet, one wonders, why are you not hailed as a hero? Why does the Thrice-Cursed still tread upon Skjaldan soil?</p>
			<p>The Empire is no ally of the living dead. Twenty times Ixilscor and Hekkatae breached our capital’s walls, their husks a tide of enveloping death. Twenty times they were rebuffed, with both lichs returned to their graves. The Empress would be honored to aid you in your noble crusade."</p>
			<p>He turns. "How would you like to fight the living dead besides a Vylmaran legion? Besides the Praetorian? I trust that you know of their power. Think, friend, of the choice you will make."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Low begins to glare. Not extremely, but enough to convey just a bit of spite.</p>
			<p>"Two hundred years. If only corpses could rot past the skeleton, times might be dimmer.</p>
			<p>Irivex has done his best at becoming unassailable. Send an army, and he takes it to replace the damage it deals. Send an assassin, and he just gets back up afterwards. If you have a more specific solution, I might be interested - if not to be done with Irivex, then at least to ruin that traitor, I've already said her name.</p>
			<p>Also, I am not your friend. You are not mine. I'm not impressed by the Praetorians, either; they disgust me for reasons that don't want to be explained.</p>
			<p>And lastly, I'd personally rather that you made your own points instead of getting a story to do it for you, but I suppose some people just can't help that, can they?"</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan puts the stone away swiftly, hoping nobody recognized the sign. Unless his memory lied to him about the ale, they should not.</p>
			<p>Watching Low and Aurelion's discussion, though not entirely listening, he realizes he overreacted to the hand motion. He still doesn't trust the soldier's secrets, but at least he isn't going to kill anyone. That's good enough for him. He takes another sip of his own drink and tries to remember - how long ago was it by now?</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan sat on a wooden chair at the top of an inn overlooking the main street of town. He and another planeshifter like him sat watching the scene, as figures in blood-red robes cut through the crowds toward the tavern down the road.</p>
			<p>"It was inevitable," the man beside him said. Despite seeming young, their hair is lined with faint streaks of silvery gray- giving them away as Talemnian. Even despite their words now, they, Luthan supposed, were amiable enough for someone from that particular world.</p>
			<p>"I suppose, but..." Luthan paused as he saw the priests enter the bar. Silence spread across the once-busy street as people gathered in fear for what would happen. Screams pierced the quietude as the tavern suddenly caught fire, erupting into torrents of flame.</p>
			<p>People scattered as the priests passed unconcernedly back along the road, shouting "We value nothing more than loyalty!"</p>
			<p>By some strange magic, the fire never burned beyond the tavern, and the city was back to normal in moments afterwards.</p>
			<p>"Here. Have this," the traveler said, giving Luthan a bottle of ale.</p>
			<p>"Quite a unique brew," he commented as he drank.</p>
			<p>"Indeed. The world that it’s from might be one of the last they haven't touched."</p>
			<p>"Unless we did something about it."</p>
			<p>"You know how I feel about interfering, Luthan."</p>
			<p>"They've interfered enough! Look at all of this!"</p>
			<p>"It is not our duty to protect an 'original timeline' that doesn't exist. Come on. Let's find somewhere else to stay before this inn is accused of treason too."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Though Thedra has been quiet for some time, upon hearing Low’s words, she launches herself at the table at which this game is being played, with noticeably less speed than beforehand.</p>
			<p>"Three things." she says, in a voice quite a bit lower than her normal high-pitched dialect.</p>
			<p>"Primarily, an apology. My behaviour may have been a bit... erratic. You see, I've been hunting down a certain... insurgent - an insurgent against Irivex, of course; there is no point in hiding my allegiance at this point. This insurgent - well, they're sitting right in front of me.</p>
			<p>I'm not powerful enough to get past this goddamn magic wall; hell, I doubt Irivex himself would be - I sense some completely unprecedented power within this thing, so I can't actually kill you here - I've been looking for you for months, and now that I've actually found you, I can't DO anything about it!"</p>
			<p>As she says the word "do", a burst of dark energy erupts from her, knocking everyone at the table back quite a bit. The air around her seems to flicker threateningly.</p>
			<p>"I didn't actually realize that you were the insurgent I was looking for until, well, a couple minutes ago."</p>
			<p>"Secondarily, the unassailability of Irivex."</p>
			<p>She turns to Neshu.</p>
			<p>"How well does scrying magic work against this here tavern? If there was someone attempting to spy on a patron, would there be any form of magical barrier stopping them? I'm not entirely sure how this demiplane works yet, and I can't say too much, for fear that he might be listening."</p>
			<p>"Finally, a question. I'm simply curious - how did you fine folks find yourselves in this establishment?"</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Low turns around.</p>
			<p>"First, killing me is generally harder than people expect it to be. Similarly to tracing me.</p>
			<p>Third... not much to say there. I saw a tavern. I entered the tavern. Now I'm in a tavern. The only weird part is that now I'm in a different tavern than the one I entered."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>As the others speak, Xownfos, seemingly completely oblivious to any potential harm, reaches over and grabs Neshu’s glass while the priest is in the midst of playing - and without a second glance, downs the entire drink.</p>
			<p>"They serve Sjkaldan beer here as well? I've not had many chances to enjoy this particular concoction."</p>
			<p>As she finishes the sentence, she instantly falls to the floor, cards flayed out in front of her and seemingly inanimate. In those cards is displayed a majority of spears.</p>
			<p>Before Aurelion’s eyes, the bar disappears, a torrent of snowflakes bombarding his vision as a wintry landscape materializes before him. The air is chillingly cold, biting at his skin as howling gusts of wind swirl in a vortex around him.</p>
			<p>Xownfos stands in the midst of the snowstorm, seemingly completely unharmed. Her eyes are as cold as the gusts that sweep and swirl nearby, staring at Aurelion unblinkingly.</p>
			<p>"Tell me, now, pawn, who sent you?"</p>
			<p>Aurelion stumbles backwards, drawing his sword. "What did you do to me?" he shouts. "Leave me at once!"</p>
			<p>"You <i>utter</i> fool. You’re playing games that you barely understand. You truly have no clue how deep the water is that you’ve lost yourself in, have you?"</p>
			<p>Aurelion steps forwards, but to no avail. A gust of wind lifts him off his feet and holds him, unmoving, in the air.</p>
			<p>The kitsune steps forwards. "I find it hard to believe that whoever hired you was this incompetent. You never even <i>questioned</i> what planet the Siannodel guild was from, didn’t you? I’d even guess you’ve never been offworld before."</p>
			<p>Aurelion struggles as she circles him.</p>
			<p>"So tell me now - I’ll find out eventually anyways.</p>
			<p>Who was it? The Black Guilds’ touches are everywhere here - was it Ranjj? Mar-?"</p>
			<p>She spins around, realization bursting in her eyes.</p>
			<p>"No, no, no. It was <i>them, wasn’t it?</i> Of course the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign hired a catspaw with no knowledge of the greater picture in the first place. Yet they managed to botch their job all the same."</p>
			<p>The pressure around Aurelion increases, wrapping around him and constricting him. He chokes as he flails rapidly, his breath being forced out in rapid jolts.</p>
			<p>"I should just kill you now. You obviously know nothing, and it would do all of us a favor. In fact, I think-"</p>
			<p><b>"No."</b></p>
			<p>Another voice, unfamiliar to the centurion, interrupts Xownfos, causing her to turn rapidly. The winds suddenly stop coursing through the landscape and Aurelion drops to the ground, breathing heavily in half-relief. The words echo through the tundra, amplified dramatically as if somehow coming from everywhere at once.</p>
			<p><b>"I will not have violence here. This place is protected."</b></p>
			<p>Xownfos reaches into her robes and pulls out a strange cylindrical object, gripping it tightly and suddenly firing a bolt of bright light from its tip into the distance. The bolt vanishes into the distance at no avail, and moments later, the woman is suddenly launched away forcefully, vanishing into what seems to be a rift in the very seams of reality itself.</p>
			<p>Around him, the illusion crumbles, snow-covered hills giving way to the familiarity of the bar.</p>
			<p>Xownfos lays on the floor inanimately, breathing softly. The centurion quickly steps away, expression impassive but shaken with panic within.</p>
			<p><i>How? How did she know?</i></p>
			<p>Aurelion steadies himself and inhales deeply. Trying to remain calm, he makes his way to the center of the room, reaching into the folds of his uniform.</p>
			<p>He hadn’t been beaten. Not yet.</p>
			<p>In a sudden blur of motion, Aurelion takes out a glass vial and smashes it on the floor, filling the room with a billowing cloud of dense white smoke. Obscured by the vapor, Aurelion reaches into his cloak once again and pulls out one final object from a hidden fold in the fabric - a metal, cone-shaped object with a glowing crimson sigil carved into its surface. Although Aurelion himself doesn’t recognize the symbol, Luthan, who’s been watching from nearby, does.</p>
			<p>Aurelion quickly slams the cone point-first into the floor beside Neshu, causing the planks to ripple as a shockwave of energy blasts from its center. As energy courses through the room, brought to life in moments, the floor suddenly disappears - turning into open air. Neshu and the chair they sit on tumble into it - and Aurelion, mustering his last ounces of strength, leaps in and follows, vanishing into the rift.</p>
			<p>Before anyone can react, the gateway disappears, the planks mending and reforming. Everything seems to return to normal - save for the disappearance of the two bargoers who had, just a minute ago, been sitting there.</p>
			<p>Luthan is the first to react - he's seen something similar to the device Aurelion used before, in fact, many, on worlds far away. And yet, he's still shocked - the sheer power of the artifact is far beyond anything he has ever seen before. But what scares him the most, however, is the sigil - those two glowing, concentric circles pierced by a crooked line.</p>
			<p>For if the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign could now create gateways between worlds within so heavily protected areas, then nothing left would still stand in its way.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Low watches as the other players are seemingly removed from play. The smoke was bothersome, but he could deal with it.</p>
			<p>He looks at the table, and then towards Xownfos' "corpse".</p>
			<p>"Guess I win the game then? Unless you're still playing. I think we can count being dropped out of the tavern a forfeit, though, which <i>would</i> make it my turn."</p>
			<p>As if in response, Xownfos appears moments later, surprisingly not unconscious. She stands behind where Aurelion tore open the rift, her expression seemingly surprised and vaguely contemplative.</p>
			<p>"You do," she says absently. "I... have... much to think about."</p>
			<p>She turns towards the door. "I suppose this is farewell. May you be more fortunate in the future, Low."</p>
			<p>As the kitsune opens a door to a snowy tundra, darkness falls over the bar as the lights abruptly flicker out once more. As Thedra appears in front of him, looming in the darkness with her mask slightly loose. A trail of inky black fluid drips down its side as she turns to address him.</p>
			<p>"I know who you are."</p>
			<p>Low laughs cynically. "Do you? That’s more than I can say for myself sometimes."</p>
			<p>Thedra continues to stare at him, gaze unblinking behind the mask.</p>
			<p>"Jokes? Do you truly believe those can wipe it away?</p>
			<p>You’ve done a good job of hiding from yourself. But not good enough."</p>
			<p>Low laughs again, this time even more bitterly. "And what do you think you can do? Help me? Look what you’re doing to <p>help</p> the Plane - you still think that miserable old skeleton you call your master is in the right even now?"</p>
			<p>A sudden flash of metal shoots past Low’s vision as he’s abruptly lifted into the air, dangling in place. The metal claw that grips him by his hood seems to almost emanate coldness as her grip tightens.</p>
			<p>"Do you have any damn idea what is happening around you? Two other planeshifters, maybe more, have scheming amongst themselves all this time! One may have just killed another just moments ago!</p>
			<p>You want to know why? It’s because they’re preparing - they know as much as you do about what’s going to happen next. And when it does, they too know it’ll change everything."</p>
			<p>She hisses and continues.</p>
			<p>"You think you can still run away from it all? You think you can run away from <i>me</i>? There’s no escape now, not any longer. Accept your fate."</p>
			<p>Low stands in place. "So that’s what it was. Of course. You just want me to admit you’re right, don’t you?"</p>
			<p>He smiles, giving her a hideous, mocking grin.</p>
			<p>"No. I will not."</p>
			<p>Thedra screams in frustration and the vision collapses around him, shadows hurtling inwards to meet him. Low stands firm as the bombardment nears him - then stops as the bar materializes again.</p>
			<p>He turns to Thedra a final time, whose form shakes ever so slightly as she meets his gaze. The voices are stronger than ever now, but he ignores them as he walks up to her and sits down to her front.</p>
			<p>"What of you?"</p>
			<p>Then darkness clouds his vision, the voices reach a crescendo, and he topples over as all fades to black.</p>

			<h3>Proprietor’s Notes: The Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign</h3>
			<p>As much as I wish to put this specific matter behind me, I believe it is time to speak of it at last. After all, what use is history if not a traveled path to be learned from and bettered?</p>
			<p>The Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign is not a continental organization. It traces its origins thousands of years back, to, regrettably, the world Talemna, one that you by now may have heard of several times before.</p>
			<p>Despite what some may believe, its very first leader, the titular Ascendant Sovereign, was once mortal; human, as much as I am myself. Though the Sovereign died before the Cult could attain much of its influence now, the organization transcended its leader’s death.</p>
			<p>The Cult has long since stopped truly worshiping its Sovereign - its members revere power instead - in all of its forms: influence, control, status. Those highest in rank among them manipulate the desires of those beneath them in their pursuit of the greatest and most terrible form of power available - that which composes reality itself.</p>
			<p>And thus, it is this way that the Cult’s grasp extends to the edges of the Plane, holding complete dominion over entire systems of worlds and having strangling roots in others. Power corrupts, and so the corrupt rule.</p>

				<p><b>Page 1</b></p>
				<p>I am greatly hesitant to write of this, but the knowledge must be passed on all the same.</p>
				<p>There is a great deal of encrypting magic surrounding Enigma; as has been said before, it "causes itself to become hidden". With each word I write I reveal something new of it. As the Shadow of Shadows, my word becomes the canon of the Guilds.</p>
				<p>And so, I must make demand of you that you neither speak nor write nor sign this knowledge to those who need it not.</p>
				<p>To begin: Rogue magic, unlike arcane magic, makes no use of Mana, nor does it demand the caster to bear the power of an Aspect.</p>

			<h2>Epilogues:</h2>
			<h3>The Lost</h3>
			<p>Aurelion wakes beside the sea.</p>
			<p>His eyes snap open as he groggily pushes himself up, wiping sand from his uniform. Seabirds call to each other in the distance as the Centurion gasps for breath, inhaling and then exhaling deeply. His clothes are plastered with wet sand, which he brushes off as he rises to his feet warily.</p>
			<p>He immediately reaches into his cloak and feels a sudden sting of pain. As he empties his pockets, the metal shards of the communication device fall out, followed by the cone. While the latter seems to be intact, the glowing symbol etched on its surface has completely faded.</p>
			<p>Aurelion cautiously taps the ground with the cone, feeling it sink deep into the earth. Nothing seems to happen - whatever power the strange artifact had seemed to have been completely drained. It seemed, that like Augusta had said, the machine was truly only a last-resort measure after all.</p>
			<p>He surveys the landscape around him. It's a large, expansive beach, with flat coastline stretching for miles. Trees line the shore around him, their leafy branches waving in the wind. Some have been partially submerged underwater, their roots rising from the bloodred water.</p>
			<p><i>Wait.</i></p>
			<p><i>Red</i> water?</p>
			<p>Aurelion blinks and pinches himself, trying to remain calm. The sea is a vast expanse of crimson, stretching for miles into the distance. Vibrant pink tides crash against the beach, water spraying against rocks in bursts of scarlet.</p>
			<p>Frantically, Aurelion looks up, gazing towards the starry night sky. Two moons, each a faint magenta, gaze back at him.</p>
			<p><i>Regalios help us,</i> he thinks, still unbelieving of the landscape around him. <i>I'm in the fifth hell.</i></p>
			<p>Nearby, Neshu stirs, rising to their feet as well. After a moment of confusion, a shudder travels through their body. Their eyes light up with recognition - which quickly turns to a mix of horror and awe.</p>
			<p><b><i>"Tasnakhaer, Dragonslave."</i></b></p>
			<p>But Neshu already has an answer. Though the tiefling's outer appearance did not change, Aurelion can nonetheless see the countless gouges and prints left by three dozen nameless fears. The demon in front of him has seventeen limbs, three torsos, nine faces, far too many mouths, and a mottled skin that's either pink or black. Or rather both at once.</p>
			<p>But it is the eyes of this gangling beast that demand attention. The loose worldslaw of the hells has torn away any delusions of space, and matter, and feature. Upon every face there is nothing physical where Neshu's eyes should be. There is only pure and undiluted <b><i>truth</i></b>, locked behind a prison of necessity.</p>
			<p>It looks rather painful. This is because it is rather painful. But not as painful as the realization that the human seems to have killed the both of them. The baleful gaze of truth eighteen-fold looms upon the human, tinged - for now - with more curiosity than malice.</p>
			<p><b><i>"Where are we?"</i></b></p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Whisperer</h3>
			<p>Soon, Darius Vaexattor would sit the throne.</p>
			<p>The Consul smiles as he descends the staircase, the dim passageway lit by faint and flickering candlelight.</p>
			<p>Everything had gone to plan - the Empress had blundered again, edging the Empire ever closer to war with Hernan. With tensions already rising near the Jossic border as well, it was only a matter of time before the people would begin to dissent. The throne was almost in his hands, so close and yet still so far away.</p>
			<p>Nearly most of the Empress' guard had been replaced with his men, with more Vaexattor troops stationed in the nearby suburbs. Five Praetorians protected the capital as well, each of which could be easily controlled. When the rebellion truly began, his troops would take the city in the supposed name of the people, allowing him to reign as regent.</p>
			<p>He chuckles softly at the thought. His plan had been in motion for years, and the Empress still knew nothing about it. It had truly been one of her greatest mistakes, appointing him as Imperial spymaster. It was simply so, perfectly fitting that it would now lead to her downfall.</p>
			<p>Darius finally stops, entering a dimly lit circular room. Apart from a large circular metal structure in the form of a table, it is completely bare.</p>
			<p>He makes his way to the structure in front of him and taps on its surface two times, waiting expectantly.</p>
			<p>After a few seconds, a geyser of blue light erupts from the "table," quickly forming into the shape of an ominous cloaked figure. A second stream of red light manifests in the form of two concentric circles, crossed by a curving line. Darius kneels to the ground before rising, his head still bowed.</p>
			<p>"Hail the Sovereign," he begins, still kneeling.</p>
			<p>The figure's voice is low and deep, threatening, with an almost mechanical quality to it. Even now, after years in the Cult, Darius still shivers upon hearing it.</p>
			<p>"High Priest Vaexxator," the figure intones. Its voice drops. "You have failed."</p>
			<p>Darius frowns. "I bring nothing but good news, Great Prophet. The Empire is almost in your hands now, and I assure you, the rest of the continent is soon to follow."</p>
			<p>The figure laughs, a hoarse sound like iron grinding against stone. Darius feels another chill run up his spine. "You have not heard?"</p>
			<p>"Great Prophet?" Darius asks warily.</p>
			<p>The figure is still. "The target escaped. Even your hunter is gone as well. All our remaining links have been severed."</p>
			<p>"With all respect, Great Prophet," Darius begins, his tone almost incredulous, "you cannot possibly be telling the truth. The target was cornered - a Praetorian and a hundred men were sent to do so. They could not have escaped so easily."</p>
			<p>The figure is silent. Eventually, it speaks again, its voice far softer - yet still dangerous all the same. "You have failed."</p>
			<p>Before Darius can act, the light flickers once and then vanishes. The symbol remains, floating in the air almost like a reminder. A warning.</p>
			<p>His breath shaking, Darius stares at the sigil as it slowly fades away. Surprise turns into anger, and he exhales sharply, slamming his fist into the wall with a resounding scream of rage.</p>
			<p>The Prophet spoke truly. He has failed.</p>

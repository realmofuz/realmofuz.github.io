        <h2>Curse of Binding</h2>
        <b>The Curse of Binding</b>  is a challenging RPG Minecraft adventure<br>
        map (1.19.4) with soulslike elements. <br>
        <img src="img/cob4.png" alt="CoB Throne" width="500" height="300"><br>
        After waking up in a cave with your memories gone, you find a tomb with<br>
        a mysterious helmet inside. Upon wearing it it becomes bound to your<br>
        head, forcing you to venture through the Gateways to learn the secrets behind<br>
        your burden, and eventually learn of its ultimate purpose...<br>

        The Curse of Binding features 4 huge levels, 8 brutal boss fights, 20+ unique<br>
        weapons (many of which have special abilities), custom combat mechanics, quests, an<br>
        original noteblock soundtrack, a levelling system and much more (with more coming every update)!<br>

        <h2>Arena Battle 4</h2>
        <b>Returning to Arena Battle</b><br>
        Realm of Uz member Jackkoh first created Arena Battle on a<br>
        Hypixel SMP for him and his friends; the minigame consisted of<br>
        villagers with custom item trades and a round-based combat<br>
        system where you progressively gained more items.<br>
        One day, Jackkoh invited fellow Realm of Uz members Val and<br>
        Lifey to play Arena Battle, who felt that the concept could be<br>
        further expanded upon and decided to create their version of the<br>
        game, which came with automated systems, cosmetics, custom<br>
        items, and a custom texture pack. Arena Battle 2 gained quite a<br>
        bit of traction within the guild, and Lifey invited other guild<br>
        members to help with the project. The team included Namakobushi,<br>
        Etherweaver, Earthbrine, and Jacckoh members. Unfortunately, the<br>
        command blocks used up too much memory, and Hypixel SMP ended up<br>
        resetting several chunks and destroying the server.<br>
        After this reset, Val and Lifey decided on their most ambitious<br>
        project: revamping the entire Arena Battle experience and moving<br>
        it onto a private server. Arena Battle 3 brought new improvements,<br>
        such as more dynamic settings, interesting custom items, and plans<br>
        for multiple maps. Arena Battle 3 eventually ran out of steam as the<br>
        guild members were busy with other projects, which caused Arena<br>
        Battle 3 to die out slowly.<br>
        This brings us to today, where Endistic, Developer of Xyraith and The<br>
        UZBRPG, decided to revive the Arena Battle genre with Arena Battle 4<br>
        on Diamondfire and create a brand new Minecraft Battle Royal experience.<br>

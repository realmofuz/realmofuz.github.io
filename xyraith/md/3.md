# Variables
Variables in Xyraith are unique to most other languages. Most languages have a scope to each variable based on where it's declared. Xyraith has no concept of declaring variables, only setting & getting them. So, it has an alternative system where you determine the scope instead.
```lisp
global.store :var 10 ;; Store in global scope
store :var 12 ;; Store in local scope
player.store :var 14 ;; Store on a player

global.save :var ;; Make a variable persistent between VM restarts
player.save :var ;; Same as above, but on a player

parameter.store :param 10 ;; Store a function parameter
```
## Local Scope
Local scope is only visible to the function you're currently in. When entering a new function, locals are not visible in that function you call.
```lisp
function :a { 
	local.store :x 10
	call :b
}

function :b {
	local.load :x ;; ERROR: `:x` is not valid here
}
```

## Global Scope
Global variables are visible from everywhere.
```lisp
function :a {
	global.store :x 10
	call :b
}

function :b {
	global.load :x ;; No error, `:x` is valid here.
}
```

## Player Scope
These variables are global & specific to the targeted player(s). Attempting to load from this when multiple players are selected will get the result from the first player in the selection.
```lisp
function :a {
	setTarget.playerName "Player1"
	player.store :x 10
	call :b
}

function :b {
	setTarget.playerName "Player1"
	player.load :x ;; VALID
	setTarget.playerName "Player2"
	player.load :x ;; ERROR: not valid here
}
```

# Syntax
Xyraith uses commands to dictate what to run. For example:
```
(console.log "Hello world!")
```
This command would log "Hello world!" to the console.

Each command has a name, and arguments. The name of the command is the first part of the command - in the above, it would be console.log. The rest of the commands are the arguments of the command. In this case, the arguments would be the string, "Hello world!".

Valid types to put in commands' arguments are:
- Strings (e.g "This is a string.")
- Identifiers (e.g identifier_xyz)
- Numbers (e.g -1.27, 19, -14, 4.56)
- Other commands (using parenthesis, e.g (console.log (add 2 3)))
- Blocks (e.g { ... commands here ... })

Xyraith puts these commands into events. 
```
event join {
	player.sendMessage (string "Hello " (player.username))
}
```
This greets the player by their username when they join the server.

This is it. This is all of the syntax of Xyraith. Despite how simple it looks, it is **extremely** powerful.

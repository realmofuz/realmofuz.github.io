            <h2>Our Ranks & Roles System</h2>
            <p>As a guild, we have agreed that rank and tier systems end<br>
                up doing more harm than good. However, we have a very basic<br>
                ranking system in our discord server, with the following:</p><br>
            <h3>Ranks</h3>
            <p><b>Member</b> - At the bottom, you get this rank from joining the guild.</p><br>
            <p><b>Active Member</b> - The most common rank, giving you access to everything but<br>
                the most elite channels and permissions. You get this by being active in<br>
                our discord server.</p><br>
            <p><b>Moderator</b> - Only granted to the most trusted members of the guild,<br>
                moderators are tasked with, like the name suggests, moderating the guild<br>
                discord server, and punishing anyone who breaks our rules. Moderators have<br>
                access to all channels, and most permissions.</p><br>
            <p><b>Owner</b> - At the very top, only 2 people have this rank. Currently,<br>
                the 2 owners of our guild are Uzbuz and Nero, and very drastic changes would<br>
                be required to change that.</p><br>
            <h3>Roles</h3>
            <p>Our guild has a wide variety of roles, some of which can be chosen directly by<br>
               our members, while others will be granted to a player after they fulfill certain<br>
                requirements. If a member selects a role for themself, but they don't actually do<br>
                said thing, they will have that role taken away from them. Most roles do not grant<br>
                extra permissions. We have the following roles:</p><br>
            <h4>Self-given Roles</h4>
            <p><b>YouTuber</b> - If you have a YouTube channel, no matter the size, choose this role.<br>
                Knowning that you have a channel will allow us to like and comment on your videos,<br>
                subscribe to you, promote your videos, and do collabs with you.</p><br>
            <p><b>Artist</b> - If you like making any form of art, choose this role. We love artists,<br>
                and sometimes we may ask you to make something for the guild.</p><br>
            <p><b>Writer</b> - If you like writing, choose this role. We occasionally host writing<br>
                contests, and additionally we may ask for your help on some of our guild projects.</p><br>
            <p><b>Coder</b> - If you like programming, choose this role. We will most likely ask for<br>
                your help on our various guild projects, as most of them require some form of programming.</p><br>
            <p><b>Wynncraft Player</b> - If you play Wynncraft, choose this role. Even though this guild<br>
                has transitioned away from being Wynncraft focused, we still have 2 threads on the forums,<br>
                and our ingame guild is still top 100. If you want to be invited to our ingame guild, message<br>
                or ping any member who has both the "Wynncraft player" role and the "OG" role.</p><br>
            <p><b>Monumenta Player</b> - If you play Monumenta, choose this role. Even though the<br>
                ingame UZB guild isn't very active, we occasionally do 8 person dungeon runs. If you<br>
                want to join the ingame guild, message or ping any member who has both the<br>
                "Monumenta Player" and "OG" roles.</p><br>
            <p><b>Chat Revive</b> - Choose this role if you want to revive conversations. If the<br>
                #general channel has little to no activity, and someone wants to revive it, they<br>
                might ping this role.</p><br>
            <p><b>VC Ping</b> - If you want to be pinged when someone joins VC, choose this role.<br>
                Before entering VC, people will usually ping this role.</p><br>
            <h4>Earnable Roles</h4>
            <p><b>UZB SMP player</b> - Will be granted to one after said person joins the UZB SMP.<br>
                Note that if you break any rules on the SMP, you may be banned from the whole guild.<br>
                This role is currently unobtainable.</p><br>
            <p><b>UZBRPG Content Maker</b> - Will be granted to one after said person joins the UZBRPG<br>
                content team. Note that if you leak any info about the UZBRPG without permission, you<br>
                will likely be banned from the guild as a whole.</p><br>
            <p><b>OG</b> - The OG rank was granted to everyone who was ranked General or above before<br>
                we got rid of the ranking system. It is the only role with additional permissions, and<br>
                is no longer obtainable.</p><br>
            <p><b>Custom Roles</b> - These are granted to our active members who have contributed a good<br>
                amount to the guild. There are also people who gained a custom role due to their rank in<br>
                the former system. These are purely cosmetic.</p><br>

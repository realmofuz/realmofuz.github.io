            <h2>Arena Battle</h2>
            <b>Returning to Arena Battle</b><br>
            Realm of Uz member Jackkoh first created Arena Battle on a<br>
            Hypixel SMP for him and his friends; the minigame consisted of<br>
            villagers with custom item trades and a round-based combat<br>
            system where you progressively gained more items.<br>
            One day, Jackkoh invited fellow Realm of Uz members Val and<br>
            Lifey to play Arena Battle, who felt that the concept could be<br>
            further expanded upon and decided to create their version of the<br>
            game, which came with automated systems, cosmetics, custom<br>
            items, and a custom texture pack. Arena Battle 2 gained quite a<br>
            bit of traction within the guild, and Lifey invited other guild<br>
            members to help with the project. The team included Namakobushi,<br>
            Etherweaver, Earthbrine, and Jacckoh members. Unfortunately, the<br>
            command blocks used up too much memory, and Hypixel SMP ended up<br>
            resetting several chunks and destroying the server.<br>
            After this reset, Val and Lifey decided on their most ambitious<br>
            project: revamping the entire Arena Battle experience and moving<br>
            it onto a private server. Arena Battle 3 brought new improvements,<br>
            such as more dynamic settings, interesting custom items, and plans<br>
            for multiple maps. Arena Battle 3 eventually ran out of steam as the<br>
            guild members were busy with other projects, which caused Arena<br>
            Battle 3 to die out slowly.<br>
            This brings us to today, where Endistic, Developer of Xyraith and The<br>
            UZBRPG, decided to revive the Arena Battle genre with Arena Battle 4<br>
            on Diamondfire and create a brand new Minecraft Battle Royal experience.<br>
            This project is dead (again) with no plans to revive.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>WynnRecreation</h2>
            WynnRecreation was a project created by Endistic on DiamondFire. It was an<br>
            attempt to recreate various mechanics from the popular MCMMORPG Wynncraft,<br>
            including dungeons, classes, spells, items, lootchests, and even a unique<br>
            boss with its own theme song. WynnRecreation also had its own fairly large<br>
            map, and a spawn area themed around the "The Nameless Anomaly" raid from Wynncraft.<br>
            Eventually, WynnRec outgrew the platform, and was forgotten about. Currently,<br>
            due to the various updates DiamondFire have undergone, WynnRecreation is completely<br>
            broken.<br>
            There are no plans to continue this project.<br>
